# Short-term to-do list

Things to do to for catwiki_p3.

## Minor changes

*these should be simple and easy to do*

* On the top bar, add a "<i class='fa fa-home'></i></span> Home" button that takes you to the current directory's home page. Need to get this working for all pages, including `/history/`, `/histdiff/`, `/info`, etc.

## Larger changes

*these are a bit more complex*

* Add a [[standalone versioning system]], replacing the current system (which depends on git).
* Change the top navigation bar from bootstrap to a home-grown one.

## Major changes

*These are more complex, long-term changes*

* Allow catwiki to be configured to be able to browse/edit any directory under the user's Unix home directory. 
* Be able to export the data in a wiki to a standalone website.
* Be able to replace all [mediawiki-style links](catwiki_enhancements_to_markdown) with ordinary Markdown links, for added compatibility with other Markdown-using software such as Github.
